# Breakout

You can see the gameplay demonstration [on this video at my YouTube channel 🎮🕹️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHW_gykfiQ4).

This is breakout, a game where you must to break the bricks to win the game. In this game I implemented:
- Multiball powerup (and sound effect)
- Key powerup (and sound effect)
- Brick that with lock that can only be open with a key
- Paddle growth and shrink
- If you already got a key, you only receive multiball powerups and you only lose a life now if you don't have more balls left
