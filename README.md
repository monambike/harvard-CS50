# Fifty Bird

You can see the gameplay demonstration [on this video at my YouTube channel 🎮🕹️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvWQVT6nFKk).

Fifty bird, a parody from flappy bird game. In this game I:
- Randomized the gap between pipes (gap and distance);
- When player has a score up to zero they are awarded with a “medal”;
- Implemented a pause feature.
This game was a exercise part from a course that I did.
