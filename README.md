# Match 3

You can see the gameplay demonstration [on this video at my YouTube channel 🎮🕹️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6uaHJ5GwW4).

This is match 3, a game where you must match 3 blocks or more and hit the score to pass the level and win the game. In this game I implemented:
- Time addition on matches
- Ensuring level 1 start with simple flat blocks and only 9 colors
- Later levels have more difficult patterns
- Made random shiny versions of blocks that can destroy a horizontal or vertical row
